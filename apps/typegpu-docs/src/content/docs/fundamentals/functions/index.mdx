:::caution[May require unplugin-typegpu]
To write TypeGPU functions in JavaScript/TypeScript, you need to install and configure [unplugin-typegpu](/TypeGPU/tooling/unplugin-typegpu).
If you're planning on only using WGSL, you can skip installing it.
:::

**TypeGPU functions** let you define shader logic in a modular and type-safe way.
Their signatures are fully visible to TypeScript, enabling tooling and static checks.
Dependencies, including GPU resources or other functions, are resolved automatically, with no duplication or name clashes.
This also supports distributing shader logic across multiple modules or packages.
Imported functions from external sources are automatically resolved and embedded into the final shader when referenced.

## Defining a function

:::note[WGSL enthusiasts!]
Don't let the JavaScript scare you! TypeGPU functions can be implemented using either WGSL or JS, both being able to call one another.
If you're planning on only using WGSL, you can skip right over to [Implementing functions in WGSL](#implementing-functions-in-wgsl),
though we recommend reading through anyway.
:::

The simplest and most powerful way to define TypeGPU functions is to just place `'use gpu'` at the beginning of the function body.

```ts twoslash
import tgpu from 'typegpu';
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';
// ---cut---
const neighborhood = (a: number, r: number) => {
  'use gpu';
  return d.vec2f(a - r, a + r);
};
```

The `'use gpu'` directive allows the function to be picked up by our dedicated build plugin -- [unplugin-typegpu](/TypeGPU/tooling/unplugin-typegpu)
and transformed into a format TypeGPU can understand. This doesn't alter the fact that the function is still callable from JavaScript, and behaves
the same on the CPU and GPU.

There are three main ways to use TypeGPU functions.

```ts twoslash
import tgpu from 'typegpu';
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';
const root = await tgpu.init();

const neighborhood = (a: number, r: number) => {
  'use gpu';
  return d.vec2f(a - r, a + r);
};

// ---cut---
const main = () => {
  'use gpu';
  // Call from another function
  return neighborhood(1.1, 0.5);
};

// #1) Can be called in JS
const range = main();
//    ^?

// #2) Used to generate WGSL
const wgsl = tgpu.resolve({ externals: { main } });
//    ^?

// #3) Executed on the GPU (generates WGSL underneath)
root['~unstable']
  .createGuardedComputePipeline(main)
  .dispatchThreads();
````

The contents of the `wgsl` variable would contain the following:

```wgsl
// Generated WGSL
fn neighborhood(a: f32, r: f32) -> vec2f {
  return vec2f(a - r, a + r);
}

fn main() -> vec2f {
  return neighborhood(1.1, 0.5);
}

// ...
````

You can already notice a few things about TypeGPU functions:
- Using operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc. is perfectly valid on numbers.
- TS types are properly inferred, feel free to hover over the variables to see their types.
- The generated code closely matches your source code.

### Code transformation

To make this all work, we perform a small transformation to functions marked with `'use gpu'`, leaving all other code untouched. Every project's setup is different, and we want to be as non-invasive as possible. The [unplugin-typegpu](/TypeGPU/tooling/unplugin-typegpu) package hooks into existing bundlers and build tools, extracts ASTs from TypeGPU functions and compacts them into our custom format called [tinyest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tinyest). This metadata is injected into the final JS bundle, then used to efficiently generate equivalent WGSL at runtime.

:::tip
If you wish for all WGSL generation to happen at build time, combine [unplugin-macros](https://github.com/unplugin/unplugin-macros) and our [resolve API](/TypeGPU/fundamentals/resolve).
:::


### Type inference

Let's take a closer look at `neighborhood` versus the WGSL it generates.

```ts
// TS
const neighborhood = (a: number, r: number) => {
  'use gpu';
  return d.vec2f(a - r, a + r);
};
```
```wgsl
// WGSL
fn neighborhood(a: f32, r: f32) -> vec2f {
  return vec2f(a - r, a + r);
}
```

How does TypeGPU determine that `a` and `r` are of type `f32`, and that the return type is `vec2f`? You might think that we parse the TypeScript source file and use the types
that the user provided in the function signature, **but that's not the case**.

While generating WGSL, TypeGPU infers the type of each expression, which means it knows the types of values passed in at each call site.

```ts twoslash "1.1, 0.5"
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';
const neighborhood = (a: number, r: number) => {
  'use gpu';
  return d.vec2f(a - r, a + r);
};
// ---cut---
const main = () => {
  'use gpu';
  // A very easy case, just floating point literals, so f32 by default
  return neighborhood(1.1, 0.5);
};
```

TypeGPU then propagates those types into the function body and analyses the types returned by the function.
If it cannot unify them into a single type, it will throw an error.

### Polymorphism

For each set of input types, TypeGPU generates a specialized version of the function.

```ts twoslash
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';
const neighborhood = (a: number, r: number) => {
  'use gpu';
  return d.vec2f(a - r, a + r);
};
// ---cut---
const main = () => {
  'use gpu';
  const a = neighborhood(0, 1);
  // We can also use casts to coerce values into a specific type.
  const b = neighborhood(d.u32(1), d.f16(5.25));
};
```

```wgsl
// WGSL
fn neighborhood(a: i32, r: i32) -> vec2f {
  return vec2f(f32(a - r), f32(a + r));
}

fn neighborhood2(a: u32, r: f16) -> vec2f {
  return vec2f(f32(f16(a) - r), f32(f16(a) + r));
}

fn main() {
  var a = neighborhood(0, 1);
  var b = neighborhood2(1, 5.25);
}
```

You can limit the types that a function can accept by using [wrapping it in a shell](#function-shells).

### Generics

Since TypeScript types not taken into account when generating the shader code, there is no
limitation on use of generic types.

```ts twoslash
import tgpu from 'typegpu';
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';
import * as std from 'typegpu/std';
// ---cut---
const double = <T extends d.v2f | d.v3f | d.v4f>(a: T): T => {
  'use gpu';
  return std.mul(a, a);
};
```

### Standard library

TypeGPU provides a set of standard functions under `typegpu/std`, which you can use in your own TypeGPU functions. Our goal is for all functions to have matching
behavior on the CPU and GPU, which unlocks many possibilities (shader unit testing, shared business logic, and more...).

```ts twoslash
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';
import * as std from 'typegpu/std';

function manhattanDistance(a: d.v3f, b: d.v3f) {
  'use gpu';
  const dx = std.abs(a.x - b.x);
  const dy = std.abs(a.y - b.y);
  const dz = std.abs(a.z - b.z);

  return std.max(dx, std.max(dy, dz));
}
```

You can explore the set of standard functions in the [API Reference](/TypeGPU/api/typegpu/std/functions/abs/).

### The outer scope

Things from the outer scope can be referenced inside TypeGPU functions, and they'll be automatically included in the
generated shader code.

```ts twoslash
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';
import * as std from 'typegpu/std';

// ---cut---
const from = d.vec3f(1, 0, 0);
const to = d.vec3f(0, 1, 0);
const constantMix = 0.5;

const getColor = (t: number) => {
  'use gpu';
  if (t > 0.5) {
    // Above a certain threshold, mix the colors with a constant value
    return std.mix(from, to, constantMix);
  }
  return std.mix(from, to, t);
};
```
The above generates the following WGSL:
```wgsl
fn getColor(t: f32) -> vec3f {
  if (t > 0.5) {
    return vec3f(0.5, 0.5, 0);
  }
  return mix(vec3f(1, 0, 0), vec3f(0, 1, 0), t);
}
```

Notice how `from` and `to` are inlined, and how `std.mix(from, to, constantMix)` was precomputed. TypeGPU leverages the
fact that these values are known at shader compilation time, and can be optimized away. All other instructions are kept as is,
since they use values known only during shader execution.

:::tip
To avoid inlining, use [tgpu.const](/TypeGPU/fundamentals/variables#const-variables).
:::

After seeing this, you might be tempted to use this mechanism for sharing data between the CPU and GPU, or for defining
global variables used across functions, but values referenced by TypeGPU functions *are assumed to be constant*.

```ts twoslash
import tgpu from 'typegpu';
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';

const root = await tgpu.init();
// ---cut---
const settings = {
  speed: 1,
};

const pipeline = root['~unstable'].createGuardedComputePipeline(() => {
  'use gpu';
  const speed = settings.speed;
  // ^ generates: var speed = 1;

  // ...
});

pipeline.dispatchThreads();

// ðŸš«ðŸš«ðŸš« This is NOT allowed ðŸš«ðŸš«ðŸš«
settings.speed = 1.5;

// the shader doesn't get recompiled with the new value
// of `speed`, so it's still 1.
pipeline.dispatchThreads();
```

There are explicit mechanisms that allow you to achieve this:
- [Use buffers to efficiently share data between the CPU and GPU](/TypeGPU/fundamentals/buffers)
- [Use variables to share state between functions](/TypeGPU/fundamentals/variables)

### Supported JavaScript functionality

You can generally assume that all JavaScript syntax is supported, and in the occasion that it is not, we'll throw a
descriptive error either at build time or at runtime (when compiling the shader).

:::note
Our aim with TypeGPU functions is not to allow arbitrary JavaScript to be supported in the context of shaders, **rather to allow for shaders to be written in JavaScript**. This distinction means we won't support every JavaScript feature, only those that make sense in the context of graphics programming.
:::

* **Calling other functions** --
Only functions marked with `'use gpu'` can be called from within a shader. An exception to that rule is [`console.log`](/TypeGPU/fundamentals/utils#consolelog), which allows for tracking runtime behavior
of shaders in a familiar way.

* **Operators** --
JavaScript does not support operator overloading.
This means that, while you can still use operators for numbers,
you have to use supplementary functions from `typegpu/std` (*add, mul, eq, lt, ge...*) for operations involving vectors and matrices, or use a fluent interface (*abc.mul(xyz), ...*)

* **Math.\*** --
Utility functions on the `Math` object can't automatically run on the GPU, but can usually be swapped with functions exported from `typegpu/std`.

## Function shells

In order to limit a function's signature to specific types, you can wrap it in a *shell*, an object holding only the input and output types.
The shell constructor `tgpu.fn` relies on [TypeGPU schemas](/TypeGPU/fundamentals/data-schemas), objects that represent WGSL data types and assist in generating shader code at runtime.
It accepts two arguments:

- An array of schemas representing argument types,
- (Optionally) a schema representing the return type.

```ts twoslash
import tgpu from 'typegpu';
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';
const neighborhood = (a: number, r: number) => {
  'use gpu';
  return d.vec2f(a - r, a + r);
};
// ---cut---
const neighborhoodShell = tgpu.fn([d.f32, d.f32], d.vec2f);

// Works the same as `neighborhood`, but more strictly typed
const neighborhoodF32 = neighborhoodShell(neighborhood);
```

Although you can define the function and shell separately, the most common way to use shells is immediately wrapping functions with them:

```ts twoslash
import tgpu from 'typegpu';
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';
// ---cut---
const neighborhood = tgpu.fn([d.f32, d.f32], d.vec2f)((a, r) => {
  'use gpu';
  return d.vec2f(a - r, a + r);
});
```

## Implementing functions in WGSL

:::note[Recommended reading]
We assume that you are familiar with the following concepts:
- <a href="https://webgpufundamentals.org/webgpu/lessons/webgpu-fundamentals.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebGPU Fundamentals</a>
- <a href="https://webgpufundamentals.org/webgpu/lessons/webgpu-wgsl.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebGPU Shading Language</a>
:::

Instead of passing JavaScript functions to shells, you can pass WGSL code directly:

```ts twoslash
import tgpu from 'typegpu';
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';
// ---cut---
const neighborhood = tgpu.fn([d.f32, d.f32], d.vec2f)`(a: f32, r: f32) -> vec2f {
  return vec2f(a - r, a + r);
}`;
```

Since type information is already present in the shell, the WGSL header can be simplified to include only the argument names.

```ts twoslash
import tgpu from 'typegpu';
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';

// ---cut---
const neighborhood = tgpu.fn([d.f32, d.f32], d.vec2f)`(a, r) {
  return vec2f(a - r, a + r);
}`;
```


:::tip
If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can use [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ggsimm.wgsl-literal) that brings syntax highlighting to code fragments marked with `/* wgsl */` comments.

```ts twoslash
import tgpu from 'typegpu';
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';
// ---cut---
const neighborhood = tgpu.fn([d.f32, d.f32], d.vec2f)/* wgsl */`(a, r) {
  return vec2f(a - r, a + r);
}`;
```
:::

### Including external resources

Shelled WGSL functions can use external resources passed via the `$uses` method.
*Externals* can include anything that can be resolved to WGSL by TypeGPU (numbers, vectors, matrices, constants, TypeGPU functions, buffer usages, textures, samplers, slots, accessors etc.).

```ts twoslash
import tgpu from 'typegpu';
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';

// ---cut---
const getBlue = tgpu.fn([], d.vec4f)`() {
  return vec4f(0.114, 0.447, 0.941, 1);
}`;

// Calling a schema to create a value on the JS side
const purple = d.vec4f(0.769, 0.392, 1.0, 1);

const getGradientColor = tgpu.fn([d.f32], d.vec4f)`(ratio) {
  return mix(purple, get_blue(), ratio);
}
`.$uses({ purple, get_blue: getBlue });
```

You can see for yourself what `getGradientColor` resolves to by calling [`tgpu.resolve`](/TypeGPU/fundamentals/resolve), all relevant definitions will be automatically included:

```wgsl
// results of calling tgpu.resolve({ externals: { getGradientColor } })

fn getBlue_1() -> vec4f{
  return vec4f(0.114, 0.447, 0.941, 1);
}

fn getGradientColor_0(ratio: f32) -> vec4f {
  return mix(vec4f(0.769, 0.392, 1, 1), getBlue_1(), ratio);
}
```

Notice how `purple` was inlined in the final shader, and the reference to `get_blue` was replaced with
the function's eventual name of `getBlue_1`.

### When to use JavaScript / WGSL
Writing shader code in JavaScript has a few significant advantages.
It allows defining utilities once and using them both on the GPU and CPU,
as well as enables complete syntax highlighting and autocomplete in TypeGPU function definitions, leading to a better developer experience.

However, there are cases where WGSL might be more suitable.
Since JavaScript doesn't support operator overloading, functions including complex matrix or vector operations can be more readable in WGSL.
Writing WGSL becomes a necessity whenever TypeGPU does not yet support some feature or standard library function yet.

Luckily, you don't have to choose one or the other for the entire project. It is possible to mix and match WGSL and JavaScript at every step of the way, so you're not locked into one or the other.

## Entry functions

:::caution[Experimental]
Entry functions are an *unstable* feature. The API may be subject to change in the near future.
:::

Instead of annotating a `TgpuFn` with attributes, entry functions are defined using dedicated shell constructors:

- `tgpu['~unstable'].computeFn`,
- `tgpu['~unstable'].vertexFn`,
- `tgpu['~unstable'].fragmentFn`.

### Entry point function I/O

To describe the input and output of an entry point function, we use `IORecord`s, JavaScript objects that map argument names to their types.

```ts
const vertexInput = {
  idx: d.builtin.vertexIndex,
  position: d.vec4f,
  color: d.vec4f
}
```

As you may note, builtin inter-stage inputs and outputs are available on the `d.builtin` object,
and require no further type clarification.

Another thing to note is that there is no need to specify locations of the arguments,
as TypeGPU tries to assign locations automatically.
If you wish to, you can assign the locations manually with the `d.location` decorator.

During WGSL generation, TypeGPU automatically generates structs corresponding to the passed `IORecord`s.
In WGSL implementation, input and output structs of the given function can be referenced as `In` and `Out` respectively.
Headers in WGSL implementations must be omitted, all input values are accessible through the struct named `in`.

:::note
Schemas used in `d.struct` can be wrapped in `d.size` and `d.align` decorators,
corresponding to `@size` and `@align` WGSL attributes.

Since TypeGPU wraps `IORecord`s into automatically generated structs, you can also use those decorators in `IOStruct`s.
:::

### Compute

`TgpuComputeFn` accepts an object with two properties:

- `in` -- an `IORecord` describing the input of the function,
- `workgroupSize` -- a JS array of 1-3 numbers that corresponds to the `@workgroup_size` attribute.

```ts twoslash
import tgpu from 'typegpu';
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';

const root = await tgpu.init();

const particleDataBuffer = root
  .createBuffer(d.arrayOf(d.u32, 100))
  .$usage('storage', 'uniform', 'vertex');

const deltaTime = root.createUniform(d.f32);
const time = root.createMutable(d.f32);
const particleDataStorage = particleDataBuffer.as('mutable');
// ---cut---
const mainCompute = tgpu['~unstable'].computeFn({
  in: { gid: d.builtin.globalInvocationId },
  workgroupSize: [1],
}) /* wgsl */`{
  let index = in.gid.x;
  if index == 0 {
    time += deltaTime;
  }
  let phase = (time / 300) + particleData[index].seed;
  particleData[index].position += particleData[index].velocity * deltaTime / 20 + vec2f(sin(phase) / 600, cos(phase) / 500);
}`.$uses({ particleData: particleDataStorage, deltaTime, time });
```

Resolved WGSL for the compute function above is equivalent (with respect to some cleanup) to the following:

```wgsl
@group(0) @binding(0) var<storage, read_write> particleData: array<u32, 100>;
@group(0) @binding(1) var<uniform> deltaTime: f32;
@group(0) @binding(2) var<storage, read_write> time: f32;

struct mainCompute_Input {
  @builtin(global_invocation_id) gid: vec3u,
}

@compute @workgroup_size(1) fn mainCompute(in: mainCompute_Input)  {
  let index = in.gid.x;
  if index == 0 {
    time += deltaTime;
  }
  let phase = (time / 300) + particleData[index].seed;
  particleData[index].position += particleData[index].velocity * deltaTime / 20 + vec2f(sin(phase) / 600, cos(phase) / 500);
}
```

### Vertex and fragment

`TgpuVertexFn` accepts an object with two properties:

- `in` -- an `IORecord` describing the input of the function,
- `out` -- an `IORecord` describing the output of the function.

`TgpuFragment` accepts an object with two properties:

- `in` -- an `IORecord` describing the input of the function,
- `out` -- `d.vec4f`, or an `IORecord` describing the output of the function.

```ts twoslash
import tgpu from 'typegpu';
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';

const getGradientColor = tgpu.fn([d.f32], d.vec4f)``;
// ---cut---
const mainVertex = tgpu['~unstable'].vertexFn({
  in: { vertexIndex: d.builtin.vertexIndex },
  out: { outPos: d.builtin.position, uv: d.vec2f },
}) /* wgsl */`{
    var pos = array<vec2f, 3>(
      vec2(0.0, 0.5),
      vec2(-0.5, -0.5),
      vec2(0.5, -0.5)
    );

    var uv = array<vec2f, 3>(
      vec2(0.5, 1.0),
      vec2(0.0, 0.0),
      vec2(1.0, 0.0),
    );

    return Out(vec4f(pos[in.vertexIndex], 0.0, 1.0), uv[in.vertexIndex]);
  }`;

const mainFragment = tgpu['~unstable'].fragmentFn({
  in: { uv: d.vec2f },
  out: d.vec4f,
}) /* wgsl */`{
    return getGradientColor((in.uv[0] + in.uv[1]) / 2);
  }`.$uses({ getGradientColor });
```

Resolved WGSL for the pipeline including the two entry point functions above is equivalent (with respect to some cleanup) to the following:

```wgsl
struct mainVertex_Input {
  @builtin(vertex_index) vertexIndex: u32,
}

struct mainVertex_Output {
  @builtin(position) outPos: vec4f,
  @location(0) uv: vec2f,
}

@vertex fn mainVertex(in: mainVertex_Input) -> mainVertex_Output {
  var pos = array<vec2f, 3>(
    vec2(0.0, 0.5),
    vec2(-0.5, -0.5),
    vec2(0.5, -0.5)
  );

  var uv = array<vec2f, 3>(
    vec2(0.5, 1.0),
    vec2(0.0, 0.0),
    vec2(1.0, 0.0),
  );

  return mainVertex_Output(vec4f(pos[in.vertexIndex], 0.0, 1.0), uv[in.vertexIndex]);
}

fn getGradientColor(ratio: f32) -> vec4f{
  return mix(vec4f(0.769, 0.392, 1, 1), vec4f(0.114, 0.447, 0.941, 1), ratio);
}

struct mainFragment_Input {
  @location(0) uv: vec2f,
}

@fragment fn mainFragment(in: mainFragment_Input) -> @location(0) vec4f {
  return getGradientColor((in.uv[0] + in.uv[1]) / 2);
}
```

## Usage in pipelines

:::caution[Experimental]
Pipelines are an *unstable* feature. The API may be subject to change in the near future.
:::

Typed functions are crucial for simplified [pipeline](/TypeGPU/fundamentals/pipelines) creation offered by TypeGPU. You can define and run pipelines as follows:

```ts twoslash
import tgpu from 'typegpu';
import * as d from 'typegpu/data';

const context = undefined as any;
const presentationFormat = "rgba8unorm";
const root = await tgpu.init();

const getGradientColor = tgpu.fn([d.f32], d.vec4f)/* wgsl */``;

const mainVertex = tgpu['~unstable'].vertexFn({
  in: { vertexIndex: d.builtin.vertexIndex },
  out: { outPos: d.builtin.position, uv: d.vec2f },
})``;

const mainFragment = tgpu['~unstable'].fragmentFn({
  in: { uv: d.vec2f },
  out: d.vec4f,
})``;
// ---cut---
const pipeline = root['~unstable']
  .withVertex(mainVertex, {})
  .withFragment(mainFragment, { format: presentationFormat })
  .createPipeline();

pipeline
  .withColorAttachment({
    view: context.getCurrentTexture().createView(),
    clearValue: [0, 0, 0, 0],
    loadOp: 'clear',
    storeOp: 'store',
  })
  .draw(3);
```

The rendering result looks like this:
